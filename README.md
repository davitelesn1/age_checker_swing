Project Overview:
This project was created in Java to practice working with JFrame for building a graphical user interface (GUI) and performing simple date calculations. The program takes the user's year of birth and calculates their age based on the current year. It also determines whether voting is optional based on the age and displays this information to the user.

Key Concepts Learned and Reinforced:
Using JFrame for GUI Development:

I practiced creating a simple GUI using JFrame, including labels, text fields, and buttons. This helped me understand how to design and lay out a graphical user interface in Java.
Event Handling:

I implemented event handling for the "Calculate Age" button (btnCalc). The button triggers an action that calculates the user's age and determines whether voting is optional based on their age.
Working with LocalDate:

I used LocalDate.now() to get the current year programmatically, which helped me learn how to handle dates in Java and perform basic date arithmetic (calculating the age).
Conditionals:

I reinforced my knowledge of if statements by checking the user's age to determine if voting is optional. The logic uses conditional operators to set the appropriate message.
Updating GUI Elements Dynamically:

I updated the GUI dynamically based on user input. The age is calculated and displayed, and the message regarding voting status is shown in real-time after the button click.
Basic Input Validation:

While not explicitly handling edge cases, I practiced using Integer.parseInt() to convert user input into an integer and using the result to perform calculations.
Conclusion:
This project was a good exercise in combining Java's GUI capabilities with logic for calculating and displaying results. It allowed me to reinforce key Java concepts such as GUI development, event handling, working with dates, conditionals, and updating interface elements based on user input.
